<h2><div class="h2">A Real Taste of Summer!</div></h2>
<p>This summertime staple is a real treat on the grill. With just a few simple seasonings and a hot grill, you can have a really fantastic dish to go along with any summertime meal.Yum yum!</p>

<h2><div class="h2">Ingredients</div></h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Squash - cut into thick rounds or "steaks"</li>
    <li>Olive oil or Avacado Oil</li>
    <li>Minced Garlic - I like to use the jarred kind for convenience in this dish</li>
    <li>Soy Sauce</li>
    <li>Your favorite grilled steak seasoning. I like Montreal Steak for this as ithas some great texture to add.</li>
  </ul>
<h2><div class="h2">Steps</div></h2>  
  <ol>
    <li>Put some oil (about 2 Tbsp should do) and a decent splash of soy sauce in a gallon zipper bag</li>
    <li>Add the garlic and steak seasoning, seal and <strong>shake!</strong></li>
    <li>Add the squash to the bag and agitate so that the "marinade" coats each piece well</li>
    <li>Let this sit for as long as you like. About an hour is preferred for me, which gives me plenty of time for other prep.</li>
    <li>Place the squash pices on a well heated grill and allow them to release themselves before trying to turn. Once they have released fromthe hot grill grates, they can be easily flipped. Cook to your desired done-ness. I like mine a bit firm still so cooking over a high heat allows me to get just the right amount of char marks and flavor before removing.</li>
  </ol>

<p>You can serve this delicious side with any meal with great success. It is well seasoned in the marinating proccess and takes on lots of great grill flavor so it is perfect for those summer nights outside!</p>
