<h2><div class="h2">Scrumptiously Delicious!</div></h2>
  <p>
    This <em>grilled-in-the-husk</em> corn will hav eyou rethink how you make corn forever. It's beautifully simple and so wonderfully delicious. Grilling the corn while still in the husk allows them to steam themselves, while also charing the outer-most husk will impart just a hint of smokey goodness. Happy Grilling!

<h2><div class="h2">Inredients</div></h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>CORN</strong><p>Get as much as you have room for or as much as will be eaten</p></li>
    <li>Grill of choice<p>Any grill will do and either gas or charcoal works great. Charcoal does tend to impart a little bit more of the charred flavor, but it still quite subtle.</p></li>
  </ul>

  <h2><div class="h2">Steps</div></h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Pre-heat your grill. I tend to go for between 350 and 400 degrees. The hotter the grill the faster the corn will cook, but the outside husks will receive a lot more char.</li>
    <li>Give your corn a good rinse and don't bother trying to dry them off. The extra moisture will work to our benefit to help steam the corn</li>
    <li>Put the corn on, and pop a top or start prep for other parts of the meal. We're gonna leave this corn for a while. Something like 40 minutes to an hour at this temperature is what usually works for me!</li>
    <li>When the corn is done you should be able to give it a squeeze and tell that it's got some give to it. Kind of like checking a baked potato. You cna cook it as done or as "rare" as you like. If you like it a bit more <em>crisp</em> then take it off a bit sooner.</li>
    <li>I like to let the cooked corn rest a bit in the husk when I remove it while I finish up other parts of hte meal. This is a great time to crank the heat on the grill for instance if you're gonna add something like a steak - or maybe our <a href="steelhead-trout.html">Steelhead Trout.</a> </li>
  </ol>

    <p>To serve this corn, I like to take my sharp chef's knife and cut off the "stump" end of the corn <strong>while its still in the husk.</strong> This will let you squeeze the corn out from the opposite end and it leaves <strong>ALL the silk behind!</strong>This is fun to get kids involved in, so long as the cobs are not to hot for them to handle.</p>
    <p>This is our family's favorite wat to have corn, and maybe it will be yours too!   <em>Don't forget the butter!</em></p>
